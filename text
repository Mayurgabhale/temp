Create a modern professional poster with this layout:

Top header bar: Yellow background with bold black headline “MEALS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE” and tagline “Every lunch is a step toward change.”
Hero image: Large high-resolution photo of Indian food or people sharing meals. Overlay text: “Your plate today goes beyond the cafeteria. It’s support, it’s dignity, it’s hope shared with someone in need.”
Infographic card: White rounded rectangle with icons and text — “🍴 Buy Lunch → 💰 Pay ₹50 → ❤️ ₹40 Donated.” Small line below: “Every plate you buy helps someone in need.”
Call-to-Action bar: Full-width yellow bar with bold black text: “One meal with us = One brighter tomorrow.”
Event details section: Icons with text for Date, Venue, Charity, Contact.
Footer: Black strip with white text “Organized by [Team Name].”

Style: Clean, eye-catching, high-resolution, corporate event poster. Use strong food photography, modern fonts (Montserrat for headlines, Poppins/Open Sans for body), and a minimal color palette (Yellow, Black, White).
